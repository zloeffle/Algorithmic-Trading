# Algorithmic-Trading

### Project Description
This is my research project about combining common technical indicators with different machine learning techniques to create sustainable, scalable trading strategies as well as help navigate the volatility and uncertainty associated with the stock market. I have learned that most traditional machine learning techniques are very prone to overfitting, often fail to detect patterns, and struggle with non-linear data. Now that I have a stronger understanding about stock trading and the characteristics of market data, I want to begin exploring the application of different neural networks to this topic. My end-goal for this project is a Flask or Django web application that allows users to simulate trading scenarios over a specified range and provides trading signals to help end-users learn the market's behavior as well as how to make better trading decisions.   

### Files
* Utilities.py - contains functions that calculate technical indicators and other statisical metrics
* DecisionTree.py - contains a from scratch implementation of the Decision Tree Classifier
* Predict.py - contains functions for feature engineering and ML model implementations

### Machine Learning Models
* Decision Tree Classifier 
* Naive Bayes Classifier (coming soon)
* Multilayer Perceptron Network (coming soon)

### Technical Trading Indicators
* Short/long term moving average crossover
* Relative Strength Index
* Money Flow Index
